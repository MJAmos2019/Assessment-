							<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Hmmm</strong> It wouldn’t be strange to question why I have now decided to do an IT course as it would seem by educational background would steer me in a different and much more predictable direction. My interest in IT is a combination of curiosity and slight apprehension. I’ve always been intrigued with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,Automation and technology as a whole. I believe that in many Industries the technological age will eventually minimise human efforts in traditional roles.</p>

							<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> My Interest in IT began in 2008 where my primary school IT teacher formed a computer club. I joined swiftly and started to do HTML on the windows note pad. I was enamoured with It and it grew from there. Prior to that I’ve always been into different pieces of tech gadgets.</p>

							<h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>As I mentioned earlier my IT teacher in year 6 sparked my interest in programming and the HTML language. During the computer club sessions he’d explain the basics to us and allow us to create our own pages.</p>

										<h2>Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
										<p>I have a very limited IT background, aside from the little knowledge I know of HTML, everything else is basic information and knowledge that the general non IT people know.</p>

										<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
										<p>I chose RMIT as it offered a fully online IT course which suited my schedule as a full time worker. I also live in Melbourne so If I ever need to go to the university campus then I know where it is and can easily make my way there. I don’t think any other university offers an online IT course.</p>

										<h2> What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
										<p>I am expecting to come out confident in my knowledge about programming and the various languages used in coding. I’m also hoping to sharpen my problem solving skills and to expanding my viewpoint of the direction and future of technology as a whole. I’m also hoping to learn about the different areas of the IT industry and where that intersects with my scientific interests.</p>
