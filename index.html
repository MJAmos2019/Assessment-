							<h1>Profile: MaryJane Amos</h1>
							<p> Welcome to my first official webpage...</p>
							<p> Technicaly this would be my second ever webpage as the first one I made was in Year 6 in 2008 thanks to my deligent IT teacher who introduced "the Computer Club" to a few eager 11/12 years olds. I hope this pages teaches you a little more about me and my intrests in IT!

		<p> My name is Maryjane Amos and I’m 22 years old. I recently completed a bachelor of Biomedical science and am currently working as a laboratory technician. I can speak a few of languages, Igbo which is a Nigerian languages, Afrikaans which is a dutch derivative native to South Africa, Hausa and Yoruba which are other Nigerian dialects. I can not speak any of these languages fluently but I know enough to get me by, I do however wish to be a fluent speaker of all these languages and many more as I’m an aspiring polyglot.</p>

							<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Hmmm</strong> It wouldn’t be strange to question why I have now decided to do an IT course as it would seem by educational background would steer me in a different and much more predictable direction. My interest in IT is a combination of curiosity and slight apprehension. I’ve always been intrigued with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,Automation and technology as a whole. I believe that in many Industries the technological age will eventually minimise human efforts in traditional roles.</p>

							<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> My Interest in IT began in 2008 where my primary school IT teacher formed a computer club. I joined swiftly and started to do HTML on the windows note pad. I was enamoured with It and it grew from there. Prior to that I’ve always been into different pieces of tech gadgets.</p>

							<h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>As I mentioned earlier my IT teacher in year 6 sparked my interest in programming and the HTML language. During the computer club sessions he’d explain the basics to us and allow us to create our own pages.</p>

										<h2>Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>

										<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
										<p>I chose RMIT as it offered a fully online IT course which suited my schedule as a full time worker. I also live in Melbourne so If I ever need to go to the university campus then I know where it is and can easily make my way there. I don’t think any other university offers an online IT course.</p>

										<h2> What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
										<p>I am expecting to come out confident in my knowledge about programming and the various languages used in coding. I’m also hoping to sharpen my problem solving skills and to expanding my viewpoint of the direction and future of technology as a whole. I’m also hoping to learn about the different areas of the IT industry and where that intersects with my scientific interests.</p>

							<a href="https://www.indeed.com/q-Medical-Software-Programmer-jobs.html?vjk=b4fb30a4f3dd301d">Indeed</a>
						<p><strong> Position Description:</strong> The position advertised requires the successful applicant to develop codes for scientific software as part of a team and on an individual level. There are required to know “state of the art” programming languages. The applicant is expected to analyse, curate and debug codes that were written by other scientist and programmers. The role requires tailored applications and programs to the South Western medical centre. 
What sparked my interest was the company it self. It is the research institute of the University of Texas. It is a state of the art school with an incredible research sector. My interest both in research, medicine and technology have all intersected at this very point. Over my last two week learning the simple programming basics I’ve come to really enjoy solving small programming issues. I believe this a job that will keep me happy, satisfied and up to date on the future of medical technology. I’d also like to positively contribute to the future of global medicine through technology.</p>

										<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h2>
										<p>The tests have indicated to me that I’m most likely introverted which is something I’ve suspected for quite some time. Introverts generally are reserved when compared to extroverted individuals.The learning style also indicated to me the ways in which I learn best. Factors that influence my ability to learn and ways in which my learning can be improved. I also think they corresponded with each other which makes my results more accurate.</p>

										<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h2>
										<p>Typically introverts are known to be quieter and reserved when in team environments. My behaviour in teams is that of a listener and judger. I present my opinions after observing everything involved in a particular situation. After all options have been explored and when I have a solution to a presented issue.</p>

										<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
										<p>Making sure the team is diverse with different personality types would ensure a good dynamic team. One that can use the strengths of their differences to the advantage of the entire team. I think those with Introverted personality types should be more vocal and expressive especially when they have valid ideas to contribute.</p>

										<h2>Project Idea</h2>
										<p><strong>Overview</strong>

The project idea is a program that could also be a smart phone app used by doctors and patients to monitor their health. The application or program would gather data on patients who are already in the hospital. Data that is significant and can show changes in the patients condition, such as blood levels, heart rate, muscle activity and other vital measurements. This program would use artificial intelligence to continually gather data on each patient so that when there is a significant enough change doctors can be notified immediately to take the proper course of action, so that human error can be minimised. 

<strong>Motivation</strong>
There was a study in the United States carried out by John Hopkins which found that over 250,000 people each year in the US die from medical errors. This makes it the third leading cause of death in the country. Some other studies state the number exceed 400,000. That number of people is far to significant to be ignored, if there can be a solution to decrease or even eradicate that number it would seem more than welcomed. If  artificial intelligence can decrease doctor error and pick up things that humans may not be able to notice straight away then thousand of lives could be save through the development of such technology. 

<strong>Description</strong>

The aim of this machine is to consistently measure vital signs in order to detect any potential changes in a patient that otherwise would have been missed. It aim also it to provide quick and accurate detection of any issues with the patients health as it arises.The application would work in combination with other existing technologies so it can be effective. Since it would present a challenge to build up new machines and technologies that would measure vital signs the option that seems best would be to utilised what is currently in hospitals around the world. Machines that already monitor and measure vital parameters would transfer data to the application. These parameters include but are not limited to the following:Body temperature, Pulse rate,Breathing rate (respiration), Blood pressure and Intrinsic measurements of the blood and muscle activity. All these and more will be used to determine medical interventions of the patients. The data collected can be processed and analysed by artificial intelligence using well designed algorithmic calculations.  Over time as the AI receives more data it will become increasingly more accurate as it would have drawn data from a wide range of patients over time. This will ensure that the aim of this project will be reached. </p>
